# Advent of Code 2019

My code for https://adventofcode.com/2019.

It's the first time I write code in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)


## Usage

cargo run _day part [options]_

  day   day number (with zero padding) from 01 to 25
  
  part  1 or 2
  
  since day 03 it's possible to add params to specify inputs set (run without this params to see options)

__example:__ cargo run 03 2 test3
